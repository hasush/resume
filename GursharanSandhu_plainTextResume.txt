EXPERIENCE
Delphinus Medical Technologies, Inc. August 2014 - Present
Imaging Scientist Novi, MI
- Lead research scientist and software developer for commercial grade machine learning software for
application in the detection of cancer in a clinical setting.
- Managed large clinical team for data set generation and breast tumor library creation. This involved
working with clinical coordinators and research personnel to identify and recruit patients and then
reconstruct their images. The resultant images were then aggregated into our large clinical data base.
- Developed algorithms that perform automatic segmentation and detection of different types of tissues
in ultrasound tomography images using unsupervised machine learning techniques.
- Developed texture and other feature extraction methods for ultrasound tomography images. Used the
resulting features in combination with supervised machine learning methods such as neural networks
and support vector machines to classify and predict the presence of cancer in ultrasound tomography
images.
- Used neural network supervised learning techniques to automatically adjust the brightness and contrast
of medical images based on optimal settings obtained from manual selection by a radiologist.
- Mentored and oversaw the research of interns including investigations into stiffness imaging fusion
modalities and 3D image viewing tools.
- Investigated the use of novel cost functions and log-scale domain methods for image reconstruction
inverse problems.
- Developed post-processing image reconstruction software that visualizes and rotates 3D volumes of
interest.
- Developed image fusion algorithms which create new imaging modalities from ones that are already
existing.
- Performed many different forms of post-processing in order to enhance medical images.
- Developed 3D waveform tomography algorithms which model the acoustic wave equation in 3D. The
resulting wavefields are then back propagated with a gradient descent algorithm to solve acoustic inverse
problems.
- Reconstructed the acoustic parameter of density using numerical simulations.
- Performed source encoding work where image reconstruction times can be improved by firing multiple
transducer elements in parallel and then decoding their resultant wave wavefields.
Modeled ultrasound transducer array beam patterns for improved image reconstruction by using vari-
able phases and delays applied to finite difference meshes. This involved using advanced interpolation
techniques to properly weigh grid indices to match proper Cartesian coordinates.
- Wrote fast sparse matrix solvers using in-house built algorithms.
- Performed CPU and GPU software optimization to accelerate image reconstruction algorithms to clin-
ically accepted time scales.
- Developed 2D waveform tomography algorithms to quantify the sound speed and attenuation properties
of the breast using gradient descent, finite difference, and matrix inversion methods of the Helmholtz
equation.
- Contributed to the design and development of image viewing software that allows a radiologist to read
medical images. This includes tools to help diagnostic capabilities and work 
ow of reading medical
images.
- Designed ultrasound transducer arrays. In particular, developed revolutionary new state-of-the-art low
frequency ultrasound tomography transducer arrays. This includes transducer hardware design and
parameter selection using specifications of the response and beam patterns using simulations.
- Contributed to the development of embedded software written in Python on the Delphinus ultrasound
tomography device. The system consists of a large collection of event driven signaling mechanisms.
- Contributed to radiology methods in the assessment of the presence of cancer within ultrasound to-
mography images.
- Contributed in different ways to the software architecture of the Delphinus ultrasound tomography
device. This ranges from simple helper and get set functions in the C++ architecture to very mathe-
matically rigorous image reconstruction algorithms.
- Applied various signal and image processing algorithms and techniques to preprocess ultrasound signals
and post process ultrasound tomography images.
- Was a key leader in the weekly planning and design of company strategy for the development of the
Delphinus ultrasound tomography device.

Wayne State University August 2012 - August 2014
Graduate Research Assistant Detroit, MI
- Performed frequency domain waveform breast sound speed and attenuation tomography by translating
and adopting work in Geophysics and applying them to medical ultrasound transducer arrays.
- Analyzed and assessed the acoustic properties of human breast tissue by the use of ultrasound tomog-
raphy.

Wayne State University August 2010 - August 2012
Graduate Teaching Assistant Detroit, MI
- Instructor for Physics laboratory class and Physics learning center.
- Conducted genomic research using unsupervised machine learning techniques such as PCA and clus-
tering in mapping biological markers of breast cancer using Raman spectroscopy.
- Researched Monte Carlo modeling of electron energy deposition stochastic processes in radiological dose
calculations.
- Wrote high-frequency wave equation approximation algorithms which solved the inverse problem of
assessing the sound speed and attenuation properties of mediums. Successfully applied these techniques
to reconstruct the acoustic properties of sound speed and attenuation of the human breast using data
gathered by ultrasound tomography transducer arrays.
